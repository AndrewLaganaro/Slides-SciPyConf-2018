**scikit-build** is an improved build system generator for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython
extensions. It provides better support for additional compilers, build
systems, cross compilation, and locating dependencies and their associated
build requirements.

The **scikit-build** package is fundamentally just glue between
the `setuptools` Python module and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

To get started, see http://scikit-build.readthedocs.io.
