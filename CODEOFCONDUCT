SciPy is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the scientific Python developer community. We value the participation of each member of this community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the tutorials, the conference, the sprints, and at all
conference events, whether officially sponsored by SciPy or not. Additionally, we expect
participants to adhere to this code of conduct in our online spaces including Twitter and Slack.
To make clear what is expected, all attendees, delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at any SciPy event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

Overview
SciPy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of manydifferent backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Be inclusive and respectful. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, transphobic, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for SciPy.
Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

Details
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention including, but not limited to, flirting and propositioning an attendee. Remember, this is a scientific conference, not a social venue. Belittling comments such as, "This is obvious/easy. Everyone knows this.", and "well actually" are all inappropriate. Questions for the speaker should include an actual question.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, transphobic, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for SciPy.

If you have experienced or witnessed a code of conduct violation, we strongly encourage you to contact the conference chairs, Serge Rey and Prabhu Ramachandran, the diversity chair, Julie Hollek, or any other conference organizer either in person or over Slack, as we want everyone to feel safe during SciPy events. The conference chairs will be introduced at the beginning of the conference and will be identifiable by badge. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
